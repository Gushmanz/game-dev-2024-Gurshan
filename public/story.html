 Title: Knight of the Fractured Realms
Genre: 2D Action-Adventure / Puzzle Platformer
Core Concept: A brave knight ventures through a fractured world where multiple biomes blend into each other, creating unique challenges, enemies, and puzzles.

Story Summary
The world of Eryndor has been torn apart by a mysterious event known as the Shattering. Biomes that were once distinct—lava fields, icy tundras, dense jungles, and enchanted forests—now exist in chaotic harmony, blending into one another. As the Knight of Unity, you are tasked with restoring balance by seeking out the fragments of the shattered "Worldheart," a magical artifact that once held the biomes apart.

Gameplay Features
Biome Blending:
Each level transitions seamlessly between two or more biomes, requiring players to adapt to shifting environments. For example:

Lava meets Ice: Platforms alternate between slippery ice and damaging hot surfaces.
Jungle meets Desert: Sandstorms obscure visibility in vine-covered ruins.
Biome-Specific Mechanics:
Each biome introduces unique mechanics:

Lava Zones: Avoid pools of molten rock and use heat-resistant gear.
Ice Zones: Solve sliding puzzles and deal with reduced traction.
Jungle Zones: Use vines to swing across gaps and evade poisonous plants.
Enchanted Forest: Magical enemies and shifting pathways create disorienting challenges.
Dynamic Weather and Environment:
Weather effects (like rain, blizzards, or sandstorms) dynamically influence gameplay. For example, rain in a lava zone creates temporary steam platforms, while a sandstorm in the desert/jungle area reduces visibility.

Combat and Gear:

The knight wields a magical sword that adapts to the biome. For instance, it becomes a flame blade in ice zones or a frost blade in lava zones.
Gear upgrades are biome-themed, like boots that reduce slipping on ice or a cloak that protects against heat.
Puzzles and Exploration:
Players must solve biome-specific puzzles to unlock the Worldheart fragments, often involving creative use of the knight's abilities and the environment.

Storyboard Breakdown
Opening Cinematic:
